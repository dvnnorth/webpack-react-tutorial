# webpack-react-tutorial
This is a containing my work completing the tutorial at https://www.valentinog.com/blog/react-webpack-babel/ to learn how to setup a React application with Webpack and Babel all by myself like a big boy without create-react-app. Why? What if I'm stranded on a create-react-app-less desert island? Also, the better you understand something, the better you can fix it.
